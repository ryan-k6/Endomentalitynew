Welcome To Endomentality!
We are a group of 2nd year student nurses currently enrolled in University of Ulster, who have designed Endomentality as a health promotion tool to address the concerning gap regarding availability of information on endometriosis in the public health domain in Northern Ireland and the UK. 
<br>We hope to raise awareness about the many ways in which having endometriosis can impact oneâ€™s quality of life, based on the physical and psychological effects which it can have. With the education derived from high-quality sources that Endomentality provides, we as a society will gain better insight into the struggles which people with endometriosis face and become more confident in our abilities to suitably support them. 
<br>We also designed Endomentality with the goal of creating a safe and reliable place for those with endometriosis to connect with people experiencing similar struggles and to learn more in general about their condition. 
<br>We are Endomentality, we want to eliminate the health inequalities faced by anybody who suffers from endometriosis, with the aim of contributing to an improvement in their mental health and quality of life. 
<br>We appreciate you taking the time to visit Endomentality and we hope you learned something beneficial!
<br><br>
Catherine, Eva, Hannah, Kaitlyn, Leanne & Nicole; co-founders of Endomentality. </p>
